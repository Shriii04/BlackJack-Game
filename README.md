# BlackJack-Game
Blackjack is a popular card game that is played in casinos all over the world. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by having a hand value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. Each player is dealt two cards, and they can choose to hit (take another card), stand (keep their current hand), double down (double their bet and take one additional card), or split (if the first two cards have the same value, the player can split their hand into two separate hands). The value of a hand is determined by adding up the values of each card in the hand, with picture cards counting as 10 and Ace counting as either 1 or 11. The game is won by having a higher hand value than the dealer, or by the dealer going over 21.

# How to Play
Here's a brief step-by-step guide on how to play Blackjack:

1)Place your bet: Each player places their bet before the game starts.

2)Deal the cards: The dealer deals two cards to each player and two cards to themselves, with one card facing up and one card facing down.

3)Determine your hand value: The value of your hand is determined by adding up the values of each card. Picture cards (King, Queen, Jack) count as 10, and Aces can count as either 1 or 11.

4)Make your decision: Based on the value of your hand and the value of the dealer's up-facing card, you can choose to hit (take another card), stand (keep your current hand), double down (double your bet and take one additional card), or split (if you have two cards of the same value, you can split your hand into two separate hands).

5)Dealer's turn: The dealer will then reveal their down-facing card and continue to hit until they have a hand value of 17 or higher.

6)Compare hands: If your hand value is higher than the dealer's hand value without going over 21, you win. If the dealer's hand value is higher or you go over 21, you lose.

7)Payout or collect bets: If you win, you will be paid out according to the payout odds. If you lose, the dealer collects your bet.
